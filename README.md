# Weather_Prediction_LSTM
This project involves developing a LSTM model for predicting the possibility of rainfall in future. 

__About Dataset__
__Context__
Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

__Content__
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
